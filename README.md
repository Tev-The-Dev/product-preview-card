### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

For this project, I learned how to use <source> to change images depending on the screen size.

<source srcset="images/image-product-desktop.jpg" media="(min-width: 720px)">

### Continued development

I would like to, and need to, practice more using the @media  querries to dynamically adjust sites based on the screen size of the device. Also, I want to be able to easily change pictures, without having to look up syntax, of the source attribute.

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp) - This helped me get a better representation of the color of the button on hover. The file did not include a darker version and I needed to improvise.
